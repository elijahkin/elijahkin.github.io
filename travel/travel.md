## Taiwan and Japan
### January 5th, 2025
Determined to figure out what it was, I began my morning by walking towards the recently opened Taipei dome, which turned out to be a massive baseball stadium with shops and restaurants lining its perimeter. Being in the area, I also wandered next door to the Songshan Creative Park where I relaxed, admiring a spectrum of koi fish swimming in a pond. I also went across the street the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, but found it closed last year for renovations expected to be completed in 2026.

I met up with Sean outside the memorial before heading to lunch: an elaborate meal including cabbage, oysters, fried mushrooms, barley rice, beans, radish, soup, and Japanese drinking vinegar. With our bellies full, we took the metro to the Taipei Confucius Temple, now converted into a museum but still very beautiful.

We then went across the street to the Dalongdong Baoan Temple, which in contrast is still very much in use. Upon entering, we were overwhelmed by the smell of smoke and a huge crowd of people carrying incense. Climbing up to the fourth floor, we could see the beautiful ornate roofs of the levels below.

We then took the metro to the Tamsui district at the very end of the red line, and walked along the river to where it meets the ocean at Shalun beach. Along the way, we happened to randomly encounter one of Sean's high school friends there with his parents.

For dinner, we went to the crowded Raohe Street Night Market, only a block from my hotel, where I tried rice noodles, tofu, guava, and aiyu jelly, plus shaved ice for dessert.

After waking up, I walked toward Taipei 101 and wandered around some nearby parks and outdoor malls while waiting for Sean to arrive via the metro. While doing so, I spotted a festive reindeer-dragon hybrid.

After we met up, he took me to a food court where I ate some Japanese curry, chrysanthemum tea, and picked up some bread by his recommendation for later. After eating, we walked to Elephant Mountain and started our ascent up a seemingly endless winding of stone stairs. The views of the city were well worth the climb!

After coming back down, Sean gave me a Taipei metro crash course as we made our way to the very impressive Chiang Kai-shek memorial. We accidentally arrived at 4:00pm, just in time to witness the changing of the guard ceremony before perusing the museum inside.

Next, we walked to the nearby 228 peace memorial park and passed the presidential office building on the way towards Ximending, a very busy neighborhood crammed with shops and neon lights. While there, I picked up a Yakult flavor I'd never seen in the US, and a Taiwanese beer recommended by Sean. We also stopped in a cat café, which was surprisingly serene given the volume just on the other side of the window.

I also enjoyed some "stinky tofu" from a vendor on the street, only to witness several of such vendors being chased away by the police as we were leaving Ximending minutes later. On the way back towards Songshan, we stopped by Huashan 1914 Creative Park, a former wine factory during Japanese rule, now converted into stalls for pop-up shops. Finally, I said goodbye to Sean for the night, and tested myself by taking the metro back to the hotel, where I enjoyed the bread and beer I picked up earlier, and ended the day with a nice hot bath.
