## Taiwan and Japan
### January 4th, 2025
After waking up, I walked toward Taipei 101 and wandered around some nearby parks and outdoor malls while waiting for Sean to arrive via the metro. While doing so, I spotted a festive reindeer-dragon hybrid.

After we met up, he took me to a food court where I ate some Japanese curry, chrysanthemum tea, and picked up some bread by his recommendation for later. After eating, we walked to Elephant Mountain and started our ascent up a seemingly endless winding of stone stairs. The views of the city were well worth the climb!

After coming back down, Sean gave me a Taipei metro crash course as we made our way to the very impressive Chiang Kai-shek memorial. We accidentally arrived just before 4:00pm to witness the changing of the guard ceremony before perusing the museum inside.

Next, we walked to the nearby 228 peace memorial park and passed the presidential office building on the way towards Ximending, a very busy neighborhood crammed shops and neon lights. While there, I picked up a Yakult flavor I'd never seen in the US before and a Taiwanese beer recommended by Sean. We also stopped in a cat café, which was surprisingly serene given the volume just on the other side of the window.

I also enjoyed some "stinky tofu" from a vendor on the street, only to witness several of such vendors being chased away by the police as we were leaving Ximending minutes later. On the way back towards Songshan, we stopped by Huashan 1914 Creative Park, a former wine factory during Japanese rule, now converted into stalls for pop-up shops. Finally, I said goodbye to Sean for the night, and tested myself by taking the metro back to the hotel, where I enjoyed the bread and beer I picked up earlier, and ended the day with a nice hot bath.
