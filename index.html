    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a first year Ph.D. student in applied mathematics at the University of Maryland, with particular interest in
      numerical linear algebra and scientific computing. I received my B.S. in computer science and mathematics from the
      University of Virginia in May 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the office, I enjoy running, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/mandelbruh/">movies</a>, studying Russian, and going to trivia in D.C.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="functiongram/">Plotting Functions of a Complex Variable</a></h4>
        <p>I am interested in complex-valued functions, particularly methods of visualization that convey the locations
          of zeros, poles, branch cuts, and natural boundaries. As a foray into CUDA
          programming, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/elijahkin/complex-plot">a library</a> for performing two such
          methods, plus one for iterated fractals such as the Mandelbrot set.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/elijahkin/chess">Implementing a Chess Computer in C++</a></h4>
        <p>After learning about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax algorithm</a>, I decided to
          write my own command-line chess implementation in C++. There are still a few kinks to work out (en passant,
          castling), but it's mostly at a point that I'm happy with. In the future, I am interested in applying the
          minimax algorithm to other games.</p>
