  <p>Hey, thanks for checking out my website! As it stands, this is a very experimental page, and I'll likely be completely revamping it day-to-day, but you're welcome to look! Right now, I'm working on this specific page, the landing page, but in the future I'd like to develop a file transfer type thing, a sort of resume showing off my past project, etc.</p>
