      About Me
      <p>Hi! I'm, Eli Kin, a 17 year old hobbyist programmer and web dev! I've always been interested in computer science and have gotten the pleasure to further hone my skills through classes at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School, including Intro to Programming and Graphic Design. I've also been part of the school's robotics team as a programmer since Freshman year and hope to study Computer Science in college! On the side, I've started teaching myself HTML and CSS, hence this site, but aside from computers, I'm really interested in math and enjoy competing in the Virginia Math League competitions to help out my school.</p></div>
