    About Me
    </boxh>
    <p>
    Hi! I'm, Eli Kin, a 17 year old hobbyist programmer and web dev! I've always been interested in computer science and have gotten the pleasure to further hone my skills through classes at MLWGS including Programming and Graphic Design. I've also been part of the school's robotics team as a programming since Freshman year and hope to study Computer Science in college! On the side, I've started teaching myself HTML and CSS, hence this site. Aside from computers, I'm really interested in math and like to compete in the Virginia Math League competitions to help out my school.
